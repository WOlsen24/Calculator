# Calculator
A program with multiple calculators for different problems!
This calculator allows basic calculations, inputting of values into quadratic formulas, finding derivatives, finding the volume of multiple different geometric shapes, finding critical points from an equation, calculating exponential growth of a value, and calculations of the mean, median, and mode for an adjustable length of numbers.

From this project, I learned/improved upon:
------------------------------------------
- More efficient conditional logic (use of if and else if)
- Error checking with conditions for invalid user input

What I think I could learn in the future:
-----------------------------------------
- Learning graphical user interfaces in order to make my calculator applicable and user-friendly
- Exception handling (using try and catch to make my programming more efficient)
- Learning more data structures beyond arrays and array lists
- Learning Database integration in order to store data from my code
